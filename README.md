# BashScriptLinux
A simple (example) bash-script for automating tasks in linux. 
A File "Logs.txt" is created to retrace the script (for example if something has gone wrong).

Different inputs run different commands.
No input = update
1 = system information
2 = creation of multiple directires with multiple files
3 = information about "Logs.txt" (lines and words)
4 or more = nothing happens, leaving "space" to expand the script
